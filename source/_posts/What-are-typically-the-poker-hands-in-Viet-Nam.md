In Viet Nam, the best poker hand is a royal flush. This is followed by a straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush, straight, three of a kind and two pair.

#  What are the worst poker hands in Viet Nam?

There are many different ways to rank the worst poker hands in Viet Nam, but here is one approach.

1. Five of a Kind: This hand is obviously the worst possible hand you can have in poker. If you are dealt this hand, you should immediately fold.

2. Four of a Kind: This hand is the next worst possible hand you can have in poker. Again, if you are dealt this hand, you should immediately fold.

3. Full House: A full house is a hand that contains three of a kind and a pair. While it is not as bad as a five of a kind or four of a kind, it is still not a desirable hand to have. If you are dealt this hand, you should generally try to fold unless the odds are in your favor.

4. Three of a Kind: This hand is better than a full house, but it is still not ideal. If you are dealt three of a kind, you should generally try to fold if there are better hands available.

5. Two Pair: A two pair hand contains two different pairs of cards. While this is not the worst possible hand, it is not as good as some other hands. If you are dealt two pair, you should generally try to keep playing if there are better hands available.
