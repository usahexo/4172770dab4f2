So, how can you make sure you’re one of the lucky ones? Here are some top tips from the pros:

8. Play for fun and not profit – if you start chasing losses, you’re likely to end up in trouble.
9. Take breaks between games to allow your brain time to rest – getting over-excited can lead to bad choices being made.
10. Finally, remember that luck plays a big part in gambling – sometimes it just isn’t meant to be!

# 3. Cash out now! Slot machine millionaires scoop Cypriot jackpot

A group of Cypriots have hit the jackpot on a slot machine in a Larnaca casino, walking away with €519,000 between them.

The lucky players were reportedly making small bets of just €0.10 each when they hit the big win.

While most people would probably take the money and run, one of the winners said that he planned to continue playing at the casino in order to try and win even more.

“I will keep playing until I lose it all!” he said.

This isn’t the first time that Cypriots have struck it rich on slot machines – in October 2017, two men walked away with over €1 million between them after playing for just half an hour.

So what is it about these machines that seems to attract Cypriots so much?

Well, one theory is that Cypriots are used to betting small amounts of money and therefore feel comfortable doing so when they’re playing slots.

Another possibility is that Cypriots have a natural affinity for slots – after all, they’re one of the most popular types of casino games in the world.

# 5. Could YOU be a Cypriot slot machine millionaire?

It’s a question that has been on the mind of many punters over the past few years, as news of ever-growing jackpots at Cypriot slot machines continue to make headline news. Just what is it about these machines that have gamers from all over the world flocking to the tiny island nation in hope of landing one of those life-changing jackpots?

The simple answer is that Cypriot slot machines offer some of the best odds in the business. Unlike in neighbouring countries such as Greece and Turkey, where payout percentages tend to be much lower, Cypriot slots offer players the chance to win big – sometimes life-changing sums of money – for comparatively little outlay.

Take, for example, Slotland’s “Millionaire” machine. This popular title offers players the chance to win up to €1,000,000 on a single spin, with a return-to-player rate of 98%. Compare that with games like Cleopatra II by IGT, which offers a measly RTP rate of just 92%, and it’s easy to see why Cypriot slots are so popular.

What’s more, many Cypriot casinos also offer great bonus schemes and loyalty programmes, providing punters with extra chances to win big. So if you’re feeling lucky and want to try your hand at becoming a Cypriot slot machine millionaire, here are some of the best casinos to play at:

Slotland: One of the most popular online casinos in Cyprus, Slotland offers players a range of great slots titles, including “Millionaire”. Along with its high RTP rates, Slotland also offers excellent bonus schemes and customer support.

Casino Midas: Another top casino choice for Cypriot players is Casino Midas. With a huge range of slots titles available – including some progressive jackpot games – as well as excellent bonuses and customer support, Casino Midas is hard to beat.

7 Sultans Casino: If you’re looking for an all-round casino experience, then 7 Sultans should be your first port of call. With a massive selection of games available – including table games, video poker and progressives – 7 Sultans is perfect for gamers looking for something a bit different.
