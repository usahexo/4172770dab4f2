#  Why Do I Have Scared When Playing Poker?

Poker is a fun and exciting game, but for some people, it can also be very scary. If you find yourself feeling scared when playing poker, there are a few things you can do to help ease your fears and make the experience more enjoyable.

One thing to keep in mind is that everyone experiences fear when playing poker to some degree. It's natural to feel a little anxious when making important decisions and facing off against other players. However, if you're finding that your fear is impacting your ability to enjoy the game or affecting your performance, there are steps you can take to address the issue.

The first step is to understand why you're afraid. What specifically scares you about poker? Is it the prospect of losing money? The possibility of being dealt a bad hand? The thought of being judged by others? Once you know what's causing your fear, you can start working on ways to address it.

If your fear is linked to losing money, one way to reduce your anxiety is to set limits on how much money you're willing to lose. This will help you feel more in control and less stressed out about the game. You can also try betting incrementally instead of all at once, which will give you time to reassess your hand and make better decisions.

If being dealt a bad hand is causing your fear, focus on learning as much as possible about the different types of hands and how they play out. This way, you'll have a better understanding of what's likely to happen during the game and won't be as likely to panic when dealt a poor hand. You can also practice online or with friends so that you're comfortable with the gameplay before playing in a live setting.

If the social aspect of poker is scaring you, try attending smaller tournaments or games with friends instead of large ones with strangers. This will help put you at ease and make the experience more enjoyable. You can also talk to other players at the table and get to know them better – this will make them seem less like strangers and help reduce any anxiety you may be feeling.
