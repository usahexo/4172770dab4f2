#  Aston Villa FC sign double striker as club looks to bolster attacking options

Aston Villa FC have announced the signings of strikers Dwight Gayle and Ross McCormack, in a move which is hoped will bolster their attacking options ahead of the new season.

Both players arrive at Villa Park with proven Championship experience, and manager Roberto Di Matteo is confident that they will be able to help the club achieve their goals this season.

“We are very pleased to have signed Dwight and Ross,” he said. “They are both excellent strikers who have scored a lot of goals in the Championship and we believe they will be a big asset to the squad.”

“Dwight has a lot of Premier League experience and is a player who can score goals at any level. Ross is one of the most sought-after forwards in the Championship and we are very happy to have been able to bring him here.”

Gayle arrives from Crystal Palace having scored 43 goals in 98 appearances for the Eagles, while McCormack comes from Fulham where he has netted 62 times in 146 games.

#  Aston Villa FC in talks with double Premier League winning manager

Aston Villa FC has announced that they are in talks with a high-profile manager who has won back-to-back Premier League titles.

The manager, who Aston Villa did not name, is currently out of work and is believed to be very interested in the position at Villa Park.

"We are in advanced negotiations with a manager who has a proven track record of winning trophies," said Aston Villa CEO Christian Purslow.

"This manager has also shown a great deal of interest in the job and we are hopeful of reaching an agreement soon."

When asked if the manager was someone who had been recently sacked by a Premier League club, Purslow would only say "No comment."

Whoever Aston Villa end up appointing, it is clear that they are going all out to try and return to the Premier League at the first attempt.

# 26-year-old Birkir Bjarnason arrives from Basel

Having already bolstered their defense with the signings of Tommy Elphick and James Chester, Villa have now completed the signing of midfielder Birkir Bjarnason from Swiss side Basel. The 26-year-old, who has represented Iceland at both World Cup and European Championship level, arrives for an undisclosed fee, thought to be in the region of £3m.

A box-to-box midfielder with an impressive record in the Swiss Super League, Bjarnason is seen by Manager Tim Sherwood as the perfect addition to his squad as they bid to return to the Premier League at the first attempt. "Birkir is a player that I have watched for some time now and I'm delighted that we have been able to bring him here," said Sherwood. "He is a fantastic athlete with great energy and a real desire to get forward and join in attacks."

Bjarnason himself is equally excited about his move to Villa Park. "This is a great opportunity for me and I'm really looking forward to getting started," he said. "The Premier League is the best league in the world and I want to play my part in helping Aston Villa get back where they belong."

#  Aston Villa FC get their man with double transfer coup

In a stunning double transfer coup, Aston Villa FC have completed the signings of Jota and Anwar El Ghazi from Championship rivals Birmingham City and Frank Lampard’s Chelsea, respectively.

Jota, who impressed for Birmingham last season with 12 goals and 8 assists in all competitions, becomes Villa’s record signing at £20m. “Aston Villa is a big club and I am very happy to be here. I can’t wait to start playing for the fans and help the team achieve success,” said the 26-year-old Spaniard.

El Ghazi, also 26, arrives from Chelsea after spending last season on loan at Dutch side ADO Den Haag, where he scored 10 goals in 25 appearances. The Dutch international winger is excited to get started at his new club: “I am really happy to be here. It is a great feeling. Aston Villa is a big club with amazing fans and I can’t wait to play in front of them.”

Manager Dean Smith was understandably delighted with the acquisitions: “We are really pleased to have Jota and Anwar join us. They are both excellent players who will add value to the squad and improve our chances of achieving success this season.”

#  Could Aston Villa FC be about to announce a double signing?

It has been reported by the reliable Birmingham Mail journalist, Jonny Vasper, that Aston Villa are close to completing a deal for both John McGinn and Marcelo Silva.

22-year-old McGinn has been a long-term target for Villa and it’s believed they’ve agreed a £3 million fee with Hibernian for the Scotland international. Silva, who is also 22, plays for Fluminense in Brazil and is thought to have a £5 million release clause in his contract.

If the signings go through as expected, it will be a major coup for new Villa boss Steve Bruce, who just missed out on promotion last season. McGinn is a dynamic midfielder with an excellent passing range while Silva is a powerful centre-back who has played at senior level for Brazil.

Aston Villa supporters will be hoping that this is just the start of things to come under Bruce and that he can lead them back into the Premier League.
