#  NBA Totals: Bettors Love the Under When Kings Play

The NBA totals market has been a bit strange to start the season. Bettors have been pounding the under when the Sacramento Kings play, but any other team and the over is a popular bet.

Sacramento is 2-6 against the spread (ATS) and 4-4 in terms of game totals. Of those 10 games, the total has gone under seven times. The Kings are averaging just 97 points per game this season – last in the league by a wide margin.

It’s not just this season that we’ve seen this trend with Sacramento. In their past 10 meetings against teams not from California, the total has gone over nine times. When they’ve played other California teams though, that number drops to three unders and seven overs.

What’s going on here? Opponents may see the Kings as an easy win since they struggle offensively. This results in lower scoring games, which is great for the under bettors. Additionally, home court advantage matters more in the NBA than most sports, so playing at Golden 1 Center could be suppressing the Kings’ totals even further.

#  NHL Wednesday Night Betting Preview: Devils at Flyers

The Devils (11-10-5) will visit the Flyers (10-10-7) on Wednesday night as both teams continue their pursuit of a playoff spot. The Flyers currently hold the final wildcard spot in the Eastern Conference, while the Devils are two points back of Philadelphia.

The Devils have won two straight games and four of their last five contests. New Jersey is 5-4-2 on the road this season. Nico Hischier has been a catalyst for the Devils offense, recording 15 points in his last 16 games.

The Flyers have lost two straight games and four of their last six contests. Philadelphia is 6-3-2 at home this season. Sean Couturier leads Philadelphia in scoring with 23 points in 27 games.

The Devils are 4-1 in their last five meetings with the Flyers. New Jersey has outscored Philadelphia 18-10 during that stretch.

The Flyers are 2-6 in their last eight games against teams with a winning record.

Both teams need a win on Wednesday night as they continue their push for a playoff spot. I expect the Devils to come out strong against their division rivals and pick up a victory on the road.

#  Cardinals Favored Over Dodgers in NLDS Game 3

The St. Louis Cardinals will look to take a 3-0 lead in their NLDS matchup against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Monday night, with ace pitcher Chris Carpenter taking the mound.

The Cardinals are favored on the MLB betting lines to win this game, as they should be. Carpenter is a proven playoff performer, while the Dodgers will be sending rookie starter Clayton Kershaw to the mound.

Kershaw has impressed so far in this postseason, but he is still unproven in the playoffs. He will have his work cut out for him against a powerful Cardinals lineup.

The Cardinals have already shown that they can beat the Dodgers, winning the first two games of this series. They will look to complete the sweep on Monday night and advance to the NLCS.

#  Mayweather vs. Maidana 2: Possible Betting Lines and Odds

In the month of September, there are some pretty big fights taking place in the world of boxing. The first and most notable is the rematch between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Marcos Maidana. The original fight happened in May, with Mayweather winning by unanimous decision. Heading into the rematch, Mayweather is considered a heavy favorite according to many sports books.

The odds for the fight are currently at -550 for Mayweather and +400 for Maidana. This means that for every $550 you bet on Mayweather, you would win $100. Conversely, a $100 bet on Maidana would win you $400 if he were to pull off the upset victory.

There are some other interesting betting lines available as well. For example, William Hill has a prop bet available that pays out 10-1 if Maidana can manage to knockdown Mayweather more than once in the fight. There is also a very interesting bet available at SkyBet that pays out 25-1 if either fighter manages to score a knockout in the first round.

So what are people saying about this rematch? Well, most believe that Mayweather will win again but there is certainly no certainty in that outcome. On one hand, Mayweather is considered one of the best defensive boxers of all time and has never been knocked out or even knocked down in a professional fight. On the other hand, Maidana proved himself to be a powerful puncher in the first fight and may be able to land more shots this time around now that he knows what to expect from Mayweather.

Whatever ends up happening, it should be an exciting fight to watch and there should be plenty of betting opportunities for those looking to place a wager.

#  McGregor vs. Poirier? a Look at the UFC odds

The UFC is set to host its latest offering of fights this weekend with an eagerly anticipated card that is expected to draw a big crowd. The main event of the night will be a showdown between two of the promotion's brightest stars, as lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov takes on interim title-holder Dustin Poirier.

There has been no shortage of trash talk between the two fighters in the buildup to the fight, and many are expecting an explosive encounter. However, while Nurmagomedov is the clear favourite with odds of -450 available at some sportsbooks, Poirier is not without his backers and can be found at +325.

It is not difficult to see why Nurmagomedov is such a heavy favourite. The Russian has looked virtually unstoppable in recent years, recording 10 consecutive victories including a dominant submission victory over Conor McGregor in 2018.

Poirier, meanwhile,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) has been almost as impressive, recording five consecutive wins since dropping down to the lightweight division after losing his featherweight title shot against Jose Aldo. "The Diamond" does have one previous defeat to Nurmagomedov back in 2014 but will be looking to avenge that result on Saturday night.

There are plenty of other intriguing bouts on the card beyond the main event, including a women's bantamweight title fight between Amanda Nunes and Holly Holm, as well as Brazilian slugger Anderson Silva taking on Jared Cannonier in what could be Silva's retirement fight.
