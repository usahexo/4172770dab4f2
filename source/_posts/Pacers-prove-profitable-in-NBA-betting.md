#  Pacers prove profitable in NBA betting

In what was considered a rebuilding year for the Indiana Pacers, they managed to make it to the playoffs and even pushed the eventual champions, the Cleveland Cavaliers, to seven games. Many in the sports betting world were surprised by this turn of events and took notice, as the Pacers’ odds to win the NBA championship shifted dramatically.

What is even more interesting is how profitable betting on the Pacers actually was. Against-the-spread (ATS), Pacers bets went 16-14 in their 30 regular season games. This may not seem like a lot, but when you compare it to other teams in the Eastern Conference, it is clear that Indy was a good pick. The Boston Celtics, for example, ATS went only 26-54 on the year!

This pattern held true in the playoffs as well. In their seven game series against Cleveland, Pacers bets went 5-2 ATS. This means that if you bet $100 on Indianapolis in each of their playoff games, you would have walked away with a profit of $370. Not too shabby!

So what does this mean for next year?
Bovada currently has Indy’s odds to win the NBA championship at 25/1, making them one of the longer shots on the board. But if they can manage to keep together their core group of players and improve upon their already impressive record from this year, there is no reason why they cannot make another run at things.
At these odds, backing Indiana could be an extremely lucrative investment opportunity for NBA fans next season.

#  Understanding Pacers odds and how to bet on them

The Indiana Pacers have been a pleasant surprise this season. After being pegged by many as one of the worst teams in the NBA, they have instead turned into a playoff contender. As a result, the Pacers odds to win the NBA championship have shifted dramatically.

At +6600 on November 1st, Indiana had virtually no chance to win the title. However, as their play has improved, so too has their odds. They are now at +4000, which still leaves them far behind the favorites but indicates that they are considered a real possibility to win it all.

If you’re thinking about betting on the Pacers to win it all, there are a few things you need to know. First, they will have to get past some stiff competition in order to make it to the Finals. The Golden State Warriors, Houston Rockets and Boston Celtics are all seen as serious threats by oddsmakers.

Secondly, even if they do make it to the Finals, their chances of winning are still relatively low. The Warriors are currently listed at -175 favorite to win it all, while the Pacers are at +1400. This means that for every $100 you bet on Indiana, you would only win $14 if they were to pull off the upset.

That said, there is still value to be had betting on the Pacers. If you think they have a good chance of making it to the Finals and/or winning it all, there is potential for nice profits. However, it’s important to remember that these bets are not for the faint of heart – there is a lot of risk involved.

#  Indiana Pacers a top pick for sports betting fans?

The Indiana Pacers are a professional basketball team based in Indianapolis, Indiana. The team is a member of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA).

Betting on the Pacers can be profitable if you know which games to focus on. The Pacers have had some great seasons over the years and they continue to be a top pick for sports betting fans.

Some notable players who have worn a Pacers uniform over the years include Reggie Miller, Rik Smits, and Jermaine O’Neal. These players have helped lead the team to some impressive wins and playoff appearances.

If you are looking to place a wager on the Pacers, there are a few things you should keep in mind. The first is that they tend to play better at home than on the road. Second, they are most effective when they are able to force their opponents into turnovers. Lastly, their defense tends to be weaker towards the end of games.

With this information in mind, you can start handicapping games and placing bets that have a higher chance of winning. Keep an eye on the roster and make sure you stay up-to-date on any injuries or suspensions that may affect the team’s performance.

#  Pacers lead the league in sports betting profits

The Indiana Pacers are the surprise of the NBA early on this season and they are also the league’s most profitable team at sports betting windows.

Indiana is 8-5 straight up and 8-4-1 against the spread so far. The Pacers ranks first in the NBA in net profits at sportsbooks, earning $8.7 million, according to William Hill US.

Toronto is second at $7.9 million, with Philadelphia third at $7.6 million. Those three teams have been overwhelming favorites in their games, with Indiana going 6-1 as a favorite and Toronto and Philadelphia both going 5-2.

It’s been a reverse situation for teams like Cleveland, which has lost $1.6 million as a betting underdog and Boston, which has lost $892,000 in that role. The Celtics are also just 2-6 against the spread overall.

So if you are looking to make some money on the NBA this season, it might be wise to fade some of these public teams and back the Pacers or other sharp underdogs.

#  Online sportsbooks love the Indiana Pacers

Almost any sportsbook would rank the Indiana Pacers as an underdog to win the NBA Finals this year. The Pacers, who finished the regular season with a record of 48-34, are currently in the playoffs as the #5 seed in the Eastern Conference. Odds for them to win it all are set at +2000, which is significantly lower than teams like the Golden State Warriors (+650) and the Cleveland Cavaliers (+325).

So why do online sportsbooks love the Indiana Pacers?

There are a few reasons. First, while they may be an underdog against teams like the Warriors and Cavaliers, they have a much better chance of winning than most other teams in the playoffs. Second, they have a strong player in Paul George who can take them far. And finally, their odds will continue to get better as we move closer to the Finals and bettors start backing them more.

All things considered, it’s not a bad idea to put some money on the Pacers at this point. If they make a deep playoff run, their odds will only improve, making it a very lucrative investment.
