#  When Is The Palms Casino Resort Las Vegas Scheduled To Open Its Doors After Storm?

Almost two months after storm, the Palms Casino Resort Las Vegas is scheduled to open its doors on December 1. The $690 million property sustained major damage from Hurricane 
Jeanne in late September, but according to owner George Maloof, the resort will be "fully operational" by the end of next week.

Maloof has been busy overseeing repairs at the 43-acre property since Jeanne passed through the area. He said that 5,000 of the 6,000 workers on the project are back on the job and that he is confident that the rest will return by next week. "We're going to have a world-class property when it's all done," Maloof said.

The Palms Casino Resort Las Vegas is expected to employ 3,500 people when it opens. The property includes 2,522 guest rooms and suites, a 104,000-square-foot casino, 16 restaurants and lounges, a 60,000-square-foot spa and fitness center, a 22-screen cinema and a 1.3 million-square-foot convention center.
