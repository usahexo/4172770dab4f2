PokerStars is a public online poker card room and casino. The company was founded in 2001 in the Isle of Man, and is licensed and regulated by the Isle of Man Gambling Supervision Commission. PokerStars is the world's largest online poker site, with over 100 million registered users.

The company is wholly owned by Amaya Inc., formerly known as Rational Group, which was formed in 2004 when Isai Scheinberg, a computer programmer who founded the poker site, sold it to The Stars Group. PokerStars acquired the Canadian online gambling company Full Tilt Poker in August 2014.

PokerStars sponsors a number of professional poker players, including Daniel Negreanu, Jason Mercier and Vanessa Selbst.

PokerStars operates satellites into major live poker tournaments such as the World Series of Poker (WSOP) and World Poker Tour (WPT). In large tournaments, PokerStars offers multiple guaranteed prize pools. On its "Spin & Go" games, it offers up to $1 million in prizes for first place.

In addition to Hold'em poker, Omaha Hi-Lo and 7 Card Stud are offered in both Limit and Pot Limit versions. Razz is also available although not normally found in public card rooms. Hosea Burton became the first person to win a bracelet at both the World Series of Poker and at a European Poker Tour stop, doing so at EPT 13 Barcelona's €3200 buy-in High Roller event. Lacey Jones became the first woman to win an open event at the WSOP Europe when she took down the £2,500 Mixed Event
