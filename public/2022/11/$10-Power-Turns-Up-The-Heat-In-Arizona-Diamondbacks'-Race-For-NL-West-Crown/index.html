            <h1 id="10-Power-Turns-Up-The-Heat-In-Arizona-Diamondbacks’-Race-For-NL-West-Crown"><a href="#10-Power-Turns-Up-The-Heat-In-Arizona-Diamondbacks’-Race-For-NL-West-Crown" class="headerlink" title="$10 Power Turns Up The Heat In Arizona Diamondbacks’ Race For NL West Crown"></a>$10 Power Turns Up The Heat In Arizona Diamondbacks’ Race For NL West Crown</h1><p>The National League West race is heating up, and the Arizona Diamondbacks are in the thick of it. At $10 on the moneyline to win the division, they offer great value to backers.</p>
<p>The Dodgers have been the class of the division for years now, but this season may be different. With Clayton Kershaw out for an extended period of time, LA is vulnerable. The DBacks are just 2 games back of the Dodgers and offer much better odds to win the division.</p>
<p> Zack Greinke has been excellent for Arizona this year, posting a 3.21 ERA and 1.07 WHIP. He will be counted on to lead the team down the stretch and into the playoffs. A rotation that also includes Robbie Ray and Zack Godley gives the D’backs a chance against any team in the majors.</p>
<p>Arizona’s offense has also been clicking lately. They rank 5th in the NL in runs scored and have multiple threats in their lineup. Paul Goldschmidt is one of the most dangerous hitters in baseball, and he is backed up by Josh Donaldson and David Peralta.</p>
<p>It should be exciting down the stretch in Arizona, as they battle for their first NL West title. At just $10 on the moneyline, they are a great bet to get it done.</p>
<h1 id="10-Power-Could-Mean-Banzai-At-The-Ballpark-This-Summer"><a href="#10-Power-Could-Mean-Banzai-At-The-Ballpark-This-Summer" class="headerlink" title="$10 Power Could Mean Banzai At The Ballpark This Summer"></a>$10 Power Could Mean Banzai At The Ballpark This Summer</h1><p>If you are looking for a way to save on your summer baseball outings, look no further than your nearest ball park. For just $10, you can buy a Power Pack that will get you into the game and provide snacks and drinks for the whole day.</p>
<p>The $10 Power Pack gives you admission to the game, a hot dog, chips, and a drink. The pack is available at all participating ballparks, and there are no blackout dates. This is a great deal for those who want to see their favorite team play but don’t want to spend a lot of money.</p>
<p>In addition to the $10 Power Packs, many ballparks also offer group rates. Groups of 10 or more can get tickets for as little as $7 apiece. This is a great way to save money on tickets if you are going to the game with friends or family.</p>
<p>Many ballparks also offer free parking. This is another way to save some money on your outing. Simply find the nearest ballpark and enjoy a day of America’s favorite pastime without breaking the bank.</p>
<h1 id="10-Power-Gives-Arizona-Diamondbacks-A-Boost-As-They-Battle-Los-Angeles-Dodgers-For-NL-West-Supremacy"><a href="#10-Power-Gives-Arizona-Diamondbacks-A-Boost-As-They-Battle-Los-Angeles-Dodgers-For-NL-West-Supremacy" class="headerlink" title="$10 Power Gives Arizona Diamondbacks A Boost As They Battle Los Angeles Dodgers For NL West Supremacy"></a>$10 Power Gives Arizona Diamondbacks A Boost As They Battle Los Angeles Dodgers For NL West Supremacy</h1><p>The Arizona Diamondbacks have been one of the surprise teams in baseball this year, and much of that is due to their improved offense. The biggest contributors to that offense have been Paul Goldschmidt and A.J. Pollock, both of whom are enjoying career years. However, the D-Backs have gotten a boost from $10 man Eduardo Escobar as well.</p>
<p>Escobar was acquired from the Minnesota Twins at the trade deadline last year in exchange for pitcher Zack Godley. He was seen as a spare part at the time, but he has proven his worth this season. In 105 games so far this year, Escobar is hitting .290 with 16 homers and 56 RBIs. His combination of power and speed has made him a terror for opposing pitchers.</p>
<p>Escobar’s emergence has given the Diamondbacks some much-needed depth in their lineup. With Goldschmidt and Pollock both batting in the middle of the order, they can now afford to put Escobar anywhere they please in the lineup. This flexibility has allowed manager Torey Lovullo to keep his players fresh down the stretch run.</p>
<p>The Dodgers still have a big lead in the NL West, but the Diamondbacks refuse to give up without a fight. With Escobar providing another dangerous bat in their lineup, they have a good chance of pulling off an upset against their rivals from LA.</p>
<h1 id="10-Power-Adds-To-Arizona-Diamondbacks’-Dynasty-Dreams"><a href="#10-Power-Adds-To-Arizona-Diamondbacks’-Dynasty-Dreams" class="headerlink" title="$10 Power Adds To Arizona Diamondbacks’ Dynasty Dreams"></a>$10 Power Adds To Arizona Diamondbacks’ Dynasty Dreams</h1><p>The Arizona Diamondbacks have long been a franchise on the rise, and in 2019 they took another big step forward. Winning 97 games and reaching the playoffs for the third time in four years, they looked like one of the strongest teams in baseball.</p>
<p>And they only got better in the offseason, adding $10 worth of talent to their roster.</p>
<p>One of the most exciting additions is ace Patrick Corbin, who signed a six-year, $140 million contract with the team. A two-time All-Star, Corbin has been one of the most consistent starters in baseball over the past few seasons. He joins an already formidable rotation that includes Zack Greinke and Robbie Ray.</p>
<p>The lineup was also strengthened with the addition of second baseman Wilmer Flores. A career .269 hitter, Flores provides some stability to a position that was a question mark before his signing. He joins Ketel Marte and Eduardo Escobar as middle infielders who can both hit for power and provide strong defense.</p>
<p>Other offseason additions include veteran hitters David Peralta and Adam Jones, as well as reliever Greg Holland. These players join an already talented ballclub and make the Diamondbacks a serious contender for the World Series in 2019.</p>
<h1 id="MLB-10-Powers-Arizona-Diamondbacks-To-Another-NL-West-Championship"><a href="#MLB-10-Powers-Arizona-Diamondbacks-To-Another-NL-West-Championship" class="headerlink" title="MLB: $10 Powers Arizona Diamondbacks To Another NL West Championship"></a>MLB: $10 Powers Arizona Diamondbacks To Another NL West Championship</h1><p>The Arizona Diamondbacks clinched their second consecutive National League West division championship with a 10-7 victory over the San Francisco Giants on Sunday.</p>
<p>The D-backs, who finished the season with a 93-69 record, will now open the playoffs as the top seed in the NL and will host Game 1 of the Division Series on Thursday against the winner of Wednesday’s wild-card game between the Colorado Rockies and Milwaukee Brewers.</p>
<p>Arizona had to come from behind on Sunday, as they were trailing 7-3 heading into the bottom of the eighth inning. However, they were able to score seven runs in that inning, while also holding the Giants scoreless in order to pull out the victory.</p>
<p>One of the key players for Arizona in their victory was outfielder David Peralta. Peralta went 3 for 5 with two home runs and four RBIs in the game. This performance helped him finish the season with an NL-leading .326 batting average.</p>
<p>Peralta was not alone in his offensive production on Sunday, as shortstop Ketel Marte also had a big day at the plate. Marte went 2 for 4 with two home runs and three RBIs. This was his first career multi-homer game.</p>
<p>While Arizona’s offense came through when it counted most on Sunday, their starting pitchers also played a role in helping them clinch the division title. In particular, left-hander Patrick Corbin pitched six innings and allowed just one run on three hits while striking out eight batters.</p>
<p>With this victory, Arizona has now won nine straight games against San Francisco dating back to last season. They will now look to continue this dominance when they begin their playoff run later this week.</p>
